A set of shell scripts are provided to test the installation of Protinfo_cluster

The 1af7_ decoy set from Yang Zhang's Spicker test set is used. A file with the
Tmscores and RMSDs from the experimental structure is also provided to evaluate
the different methods.

Due to the limitations of filesizes a link is provide to the directory to be downloaded
The bzipped archive should uncompressed and placed in this directory

Four tests are provided. 

test_rmsd.densitysh test_rmsd.<avx,sse2,sse3>
  
Use RMSD as the metric to calculate density without creating a similarity matrix
Best measure of RMSD calculation speed as write times to matrix are significant 
given the speed of the RMSD calculations

test_rmsd.sh test_rmsd.<avx,sse2,sse3>  

Use RMSD as the metric to cluster 10,000 decoys using hierarchical clustering 
with complete linkage.


test_tmscore.sh test_tmscore.<avx,sse2,sse3>  

Use TMscore as the metric to cluster 300 decoys using hierarchical clustering 
with complete linkage.


test_rmsd_tmscore.sh test_rmsd_tmscore.<avx,sse2,sse3>  

Use RMSD as the metric and iterative density to prune an intial set of 10000
structures to 300 and then using TMscore as a metric to cluster using kmeans.
